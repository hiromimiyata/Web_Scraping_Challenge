# Web_Scraping_Challenge
Module_11
Goals: 
Deliverable 1: To scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Deliverable 2: To scrape and analyze Mars weather data.


I scraped the Mars News website using automated browsing and Beautiful Soup. I extracted the titles and preview text of each news article and stored the data in Python dictionaries. I printed the dictionaries in a Python list.

Next, I scraped and analyzed Mars weather data from the Mars Temperature Data Site using Beautiful Soup and Pandas. I assembled the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame and used Pandas functions to answer several questions. These included how many months exist on Mars, how many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset, and what are the coldest and warmest months on Mars at the location of Curiosity. I plotted the results as bar charts.

I also found the months with the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars by calculating the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months and plotted the results as bar charts.  I estimated how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year by considering the number of days that elapse on Earth in the time it takes Mars to circle the Sun once. I plotted the daily minimum temperature to visually estimate the result. Lastly, I exported the final DataFrame to a CSV file.
